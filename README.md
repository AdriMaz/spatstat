spatstat
========

This repository holds the currently released source code for spatstat.

Users of spatstat are encouraged to report bugs and make feature requests here. Feel free to fork spatstat and make a pull request. However, we are only in the process of moving to git and github, so this is not the actual development code at the moment and your pull request may have to wait until the next official release.

We aim at making this repository contain a development version of spatstat in the "near" future.
